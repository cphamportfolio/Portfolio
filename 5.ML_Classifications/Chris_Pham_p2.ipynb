    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "ANSWER: To be honest, I am not sure what I am supposed to be looking for but I guess I see that \"cheers kent\" is the highest for alt.atheism and talk.religion.misc. This is interesting because comparing Atheist to Religions, you would think something like \"jesus christ\" would be greater but instead here its \"cheers kent\""

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular. With your new preprocessor, how much did you reduce the size of the dictionary?\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
